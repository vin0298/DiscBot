## Introduction to CarlBot 
A simple music bot for discord that is able to stream YouTube videos for all the users
in the voice channel.  This bot is initially for personal use but I plan to develop it further to make it more robust and capable for the Discord community to use.


Current Features:  
1. Able to play single URL.  
2. Able to play whole Youtube playlist.  
3. Basic music player functionality (Skip, Pause, Unpause)

Future Features:  
1. Youtube search (in-progress)  
2. Roles Management

Note: This bot is currently deployed on a DigitalOcean droplet (Might change in the future).

## Adding the Bot to Your Server
1. Login to your Discord app and make sure that you have the "Manage Server" permissions on the server you wish to add the bot to.  
2. Use this link and add the bot to the server you want to add it to: https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=431272942588919808&scope=bot&permissions=0
